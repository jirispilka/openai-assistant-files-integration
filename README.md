The Apify OpenAI Vector Store integration allows dynamic updates to the OpenAI Assistant files.
It assumes that you have already created an [OpenAI Assistant](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview/agents)
and [OpenAI Vector Store](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/file-search/vector-stores)
and you need to regularly update the files to provide up-to-date responses.

ðŸ’¡ **Note**: This Actor is meant to be used together with other Actors' integration sections.
For instance, if you are using the [Website Content Crawler](https://apify.com/apify/website-content-crawler),
you can activate Vector Store Files integration to save web data for your OpenAI assistant.

## How does OpenAI Assistant Integration work?

Data for the Vector Store and Assistant are provided by various [Apify actors](https://apify.com/store).

The integration process includes:
- Loading data from an Apify Actor
- Processing the data to comply with OpenAI Assistant limits (max. 1000 files, max 5,000,000 tokens)
- Creating OpenAI files [OpenAI Files](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/files)
- [Optional] Removing existing files from the Vector Store (specified by `file_ids_to_delete` and/or `file_prefix`)
- Adding the newly created files to the vector store.
- [Optional] Deleting existing files from the OpenAI files (specified by `file_ids_to_delete` and/or `file_prefix`)

## How much does it cost?
Find the average usage cost for this actor on the [pricing page](https://apify.com/pricing) under the `Which plan do I need?` section.
Additional costs are associated with the use of OpenAI Assistant. Please refer to their [pricing](https://openai.com/pricing) for details.

## Before you start

To utilize this integration, ensure you have:

- An OpenAI account and an `OpenAI API token`. Create a free account at [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/).
- Created an [OpenAI Vector Store](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/file-search/vector-stores). You will need `vector_store_id` to run this integration.
- Created an [OpenAI Assistant](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview).

## Inputs

Refer to [input schema](.actor/input_schema.json) for details.

- `vector_store_id` - OpenAI Vector Store ID
- `openai_api_key` - OpenAI API key
- `assistant_id`: The ID of an OpenAI Assistant. This parameter is required only when a file exceeds the OpenAI
   size limit of 5,000,000 tokens (as of 2024-04-23). When necessary, the model associated with the assistant is
   utilized to count tokens and split the large file into smaller, manageable segments.
- `fields` - Array of fields you want to save, e.g., `["url", "text", "metadata.title"]`.
- `file_ids_to_delete` - Delete specified file IDs from vector store as needed.
- `file_prefix` - Delete and create files using a file_prefix, streamlining vector store updates.
- `dataset_id`: [Debug] Dataset ID (when running Actor as standalone without integration).

## Outputs

This integration saves selected fields from your Actor to the OpenAI Assistant and optionally to Actor Key Value Storage (useful for debugging).
